== Adding new packages

ALMighty uses https://glide.sh[Glide] for package management.  To
install a new package, you can follow these steps.  The `<URL>` should
be replaced with the package URL pointing to Github or any other
location.

[source, bash]
glide get <URL>
glide update
git add glide.yaml glide.lock
git commit -m "<message>"

NOTE: If the `glide get` commands prompts for versions range, most of the
time you must select `M` (minor).
